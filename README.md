# Wuzzuf Database Project

## Overview
This repo includes my design and implementation of the Wuzzuf project for the Fundamentals of Database course. The project allows users to get information about the available jobs in the market in the field ot IT/Software Development in Egypt. The [Wuzzuf](https://wuzzuf.net/jobs/egypt) website has limited abilities for filtering or doing some higher level aggregations on many features which my application will be used to provide more flexibility on that front. 

## Database Design
The initial Entity Relationship Diagram is found in this file [ERD](https://github.com/omar-bahgat/MyWuzzuf-DB/blob/main/Entity-Relationship%20Diagram.pdf). The updated Relational Model is found in this file [RM](https://github.com/omar-bahgat/MyWuzzuf-DB/blob/main/Relational%20Model.pdf). The transcript for the SQL statements used to create the database is found in this file [Transcript](https://github.com/omar-bahgat/MyWuzzuf-DB/blob/main/wuzzuf_db.sql).

## Data Scraping
The data was scraped from Wuzzuf from the [IT/Software Development](https://wuzzuf.net/a/IT-Software-Development-Jobs-in-Egypt) page using Beautiful Soup and Selenium. The scraper scripts can be found inside [Scraper Scripts](https://github.com/omar-bahgat/MyWuzzuf-DB/tree/main/Scraper%20Scripts) and the data scraped can be found in [CSV Files](https://github.com/omar-bahgat/MyWuzzuf-DB/tree/main/CSV%20Files). All dump files are also included in [Dump Files](https://github.com/omar-bahgat/MyWuzzuf-DB/tree/main/Dump%20Files).
